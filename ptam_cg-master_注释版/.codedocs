# CodeDocs Configuration

# Include the Doxygen configuration from another file.
# The file must be a relative path with respect to the root of the repository.

# paths will be considered relative to the root of the repository, not the
# location of the DOXYFILE.

# DOXYFILE =

# Specify external repository to link documentation with.
# This is similar to Doxygen's TAGFILES option, but will automatically link to
# tags of other repositories already using CodeDocs. List each repository to
# link with by giving its location in the form of owner/repository.
# For example:
#   TAGLINKS = doxygen/doxygen CodeDocs/osg
# Note: these repositories must already be built on CodeDocs.

# Optional project name, if left empty the GitHub repository name will be used.
