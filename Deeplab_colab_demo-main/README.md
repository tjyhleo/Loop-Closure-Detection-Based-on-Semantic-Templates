* [W1_SImplified_Kitti_Distorted(RAW)_of_Local_Zip_of_DeepLab_Demo.ipynb](https://github.com/Dkaka/Deeplab_colab_demo/blob/main/W1_SImplified_Kitti_Distorted(RAW)_of_Local_Zip_of_DeepLab_Demo.ipynb) is the minimal example with just local extraction from google drive zipped image and pack result back to drive. Minimal example to get things going.

* [local_of_SImplified_Kitti_Distorted(RAW)_of_Local_Zip_of_DeepLab_Demo.ipynb](https://github.com/Dkaka/Deeplab_colab_demo/blob/main/local_of_SImplified_Kitti_Distorted(RAW)_of_Local_Zip_of_DeepLab_Demo.ipynb) is the one tested for local runtime (use GPU locally) and file locally. This one has some visualization and image pre-format code.(dataset specific).
